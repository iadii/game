Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instructions
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/iadii/snake-game.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser to start playing the Snake game.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
The snake will continuously move in the current direction.
The goal is to eat the food (green square) to grow the snake.
Avoid collisions with the game board boundaries and the snake's own body.
Features
Responsive design: Play the game on various screen sizes.
Collision detection: The game will reset if the snake collides with the board boundaries or itself.
Food generation: A new food item appears when the snake consumes the existing one.
Dynamic rendering: The game board updates dynamically based on the snake's movement and food consumption.
Code Overview
The game logic is implemented in the updateGame, moveSnake, checkCollision, checkFood, growSnake, generateFood, renderGame, and resetGame functions.
The snake's position and direction are managed through the snake array and direction variable.
Food coordinates are stored in the food object.
Event listeners handle user input via arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
The game updates every 200 milliseconds using setInterval.
